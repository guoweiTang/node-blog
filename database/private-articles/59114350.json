However, if you don't care about any incoming files, you can simply not listen for the 'file' event at all and any/all files will be automatically and safely discarded (these discarded files do still count towards files and parts limits).\r\nIf a configured file size limit was reached, stream will both have a boolean property truncated (best checked at the end of the stream) and emit a 'limit' event to notify you when this happens.\r\nfield(< string >fieldname, < string >value, < boolean >fieldnameTruncated, < boolean >valueTruncated, < string >transferEncoding, < string >mimeType) - Emitted for each new non-file field found.\r\n\r\npartsLimit() - Emitted when specified parts limit has been reached.
